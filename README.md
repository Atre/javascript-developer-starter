### 0.1.6 ⋅ Folder Structure
>Create basic environment
>
Let's create a common for many developers file structure
```
|-- src
|-- dist
|-- index.html
```

> `src` is for your `s`ou`rc`e code
>
> `dist` for Webpack to store compiled modules there
>
> and we will keep `index.html` in a project root as a basic static file

```bash
mkdir src dist && touch index.html
```
And we are finishing with updating our index file with the basic [HTML 5][5]
template
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>javascript_developer_starter</title>
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
```
